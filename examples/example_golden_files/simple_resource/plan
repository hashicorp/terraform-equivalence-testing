Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # tfcoremock_simple_resource.simple_resource will be created
  + resource "tfcoremock_simple_resource" "simple_resource" {
      + id      = "192977d6-b169-4170-a9d4-ee1dcef7c6ea"
      + integer = 1
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Warning: Duplicate required provider

  on main.tf line 3, in terraform:
   3:     mock = {
   4:       source = "hashicorp/tfcoremock"
   5:     }

Provider hashicorp/tfcoremock with the local name "mock" was implicitly
required via a configuration block as "tfcoremock". The provider
configuration block name must match the name used in required_providers.

(and one more similar warning elsewhere)

Saved the plan to: equivalence_test_plan

To perform exactly these actions, run the following command to apply:
    terraform apply "equivalence_test_plan"
